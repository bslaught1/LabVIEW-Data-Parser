# Ideas

- [x] choose where you can put data
  - [x] csv
  - [x] excel
  - [x] graph on matplot lib
- [x] Tells you number of data arrays
  - [x] and detail about each array
- [x] files
  - [x] main.py
  - [x] parse.py
  - [x] plot.py (
    - [ ] could possibly move to parse? (and rename to something)
  - [x] savefile (all in one file)
    - [x] makecsv.py
    - [x] makexl.py
    - [x] makemat.py
- [x] scipy.io.savemat for .mat MATLAB files!
- [ ] make separator flexible
- [ ] check for filetype before parse
- [ ] Graphs
  - [ ] plot multiple variables on one graph
  - [ ] make plot title and and axes titles editable?
- [ ] "\*\*\*End_of_Header\*\*\*\\t\\t" changes each time
  - dependent on number of columns I think
- [ ] Change variable names from (xyzabc..) to column names given in lvm doc
  - [ ] add variable names to xl files (not sure why they weren't there before)
  - [ ] maybe also keep track of units from "y_unit_label" and "x_unit_label"
